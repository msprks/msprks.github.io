      <i><u><a target="blank" href="https://www.mesparks.com/in_your_painting/">in_your_painting</i></u></a>, 2022 is part of a series of browser-based works exploring quotation, collage, and language. Drawing from the history of Dada poetry, <i>in_your_painting</i> uses a hand-coded computer program to generate a series of phrases, which seem to lead us through someone else’s space.
      The narrative is partially constructed through a random sampling of titles from the mid-twentieth-century paintings of Balthus, all of which depict the young female body.
      Iterations of this work were included in the exhibitions <i>and a Rag in the Other</i> at the Alternator Centre and <i>We can only hint at this with words</i> at the Gordon Smith Gallery for Candian Art.

      <i>Inside Out</i>, 2018 is a collaborative project developed with <u><a target="blank" href="https://www.matthisgrunsky.ca">Matthis Grunsky</u></a> and the mobile workspace of <u><a target="blank" href="http://leahweinstein.com/projects/sitefactory/">Site Factory,</u></a> Vancouver, BC.
      An assembly of resonstructed studio objects (blank canvases, chairs, ladders, easels) is staged within the space of a modified school bus, performing as a fractured screen for a shifting projection of pattern and colour.
      The projected colours, sampled randomly from an archive of historical artworks, act as a method of mapping the transformation of three-dimensional space into a flattened, two-dimensional picture, mimicking the flat space of a painting.
      This project emerged from an exploration into the trope of the artist’s studio, its depiction throughout art history, and its relevance amidst a “post-studio” condition currently dictated by prohibitive rental costs.
